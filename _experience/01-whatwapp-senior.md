As Senior Game Developer for "Burraco: la Sfida," I led the client-side development, optimizing the codebase and driving the implementation of new gameplay features in close collaboration with the server developers and with UI/UX designers in order to create an interactible and polished front-end experience. My efforts contributed to the game reaching the 6th spot among the Top Grossing Card games on Google Play. I managed Live-Ops for more than 135,000 monthly active users, ensuring a seamless and engaging player experience. I also played a key role in refactoring the server backend to a new platform, maintaining uninterrupted service throughout the transition.
