As Game Developer for "Burraco: la Sfida," I contributed to both front-end and back-end development for this classic Italian card game. I was responsible for implementing new features and maintaining the game’s core systems. During this time, I also designed and developed an optimized, highly configurable matchmaking system to enhance the player experience.
