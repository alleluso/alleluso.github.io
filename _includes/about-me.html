      Hi, I'm Alessandro—a game developer who's spent the last seven years building interactive experiences, mostly in Unity and Unreal Engine. 
      I started my career in London testing games and making sure Italian translations didn't sound ridiculous, which taught me to care 
      deeply about the little details that make games feel polished.

      These days, I split my time between professional work—optimizing systems, building features for live games, and keeping tens of thousands 
      of players engaged—and personal projects where I get to experiment freely. I'm fascinated by the intersection of code and art: writing 
      custom shaders, rigging complex 3D models, building tools that animate virtual pianos from real MIDI input. There's something satisfying 
      about making digital things behave like their physical counterparts.

      I'm naturally curious, which means I'm always learning something new. Lately, I've been exploring how AI can accelerate development 
      without losing the craft, diving into procedural animation systems, and revisiting childhood memories through 3D—like recreating that 
      vintage lava lamp that's been sitting on my shelf for decades, or modeling my dad's custom-built RC car. I also have a soft spot for 
      modding classic games and pushing old engines to do things they weren't quite designed for.
    </p>

      When I'm not at my desk, I'm probably playing around with music production, tinkering with hardware, or just seeing how far I can 
      push a rendering technique before something breaks. I believe the best way to understand how something works is to take it apart 
      and build it yourself—preferably with better shaders.
    </p>

      This is clearly written by AI to sound more interesting than "I like making games and 3D stuff", but hey, if it gets the point across,
      I'm all for it.
