    <p>The <b>Adventure</b> is a time-limited, single-player event that takes place across three distinct
      worlds. The ultimate goal is to reach the end of these worlds and earn exclusive rewards.</p>
    <p>Progression is structured around levels, each of which must be completed by winning a game of Burraco
      against an opponent. To enter a level, players must spend a special resource called <b>Steps</b>.</p>
    <p>Participation in these challenges requires both <b>Steps</b> and <b>Coins</b>. Winning a match rewards
      the player with additional Coins and Steps, allowing them to continue progressing through the adventure.

    <p>One of the key requirements outlined in the Game Design Document (GDD) was the ability to <b>remotely
        configure both the number of steps</b> a user must complete in each world, as well as <b>the total
        length of the map</b>. This
      flexibility was essential to tailor the experience and balance progression for different user segments.
      For example,
      User A might encounter three worlds with three steps each, while User B could progress through two
      worlds
      with six steps each. It quickly became clear that a static background per world would not meet these
      needs.</p>

    <p>To solve this, I proposed and implemented a <b>procedural generation system</b> that would allow an
      adventure map to be
      dynamically built at runtime. I designed the system to break the map into worlds, and each world into
      modular <b>tiles</b>.
      Tiles are reusable segments of road that could be arranged to form a continuous, coherent path. The only
      constraint I introduced
      was that all tiles within the same world must share a consistent graphical border. This made arbitrary
      rearrangement possible.</p>

    <p>I structured each world to consist of a start tile, an end tile, and an indefinite number of middle and
      connector tiles.
      To make the system flexible and designer-friendly, I defined these tile sets within a ScriptableObject
      container, which is then used by the
      <code>AdventureMapGenerator</code> system. I also built such generator to take a configurable number of
      steps per world
      and procedurally assemble the appropriate tile sequence. Once the layout is generated, a spline is
      created to represent the road connecting all steps.
      By using ScriptableObjects, I ensured the system could support <b>dynamic updates via AssetBundles or
        Addressables</b>,
      allowing for rapid iteration and easy deployment of new map environments.
