      Bocce Galore was the first game I created and released for Android, right after finishing university. My goal was to develop a simple concept with unique mechanics that hadn’t been explored before. Inspired by the Italian game of Bocce, players take turns tossing balls, aiming to get as close as possible to the target ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game uses physics-based interactions and simple controls. Two players can compete on the same device, or you can play solo against an AI with adjustable difficulty. I had plans for online multiplayer, but never found the time nor I had the experience to add it. The first version included just one court, but I later released more courts as free updates. There was also a basic store where players could buy new ball designs using in-game currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players could toss balls in two ways. The first was a straightforward tap-and-drag mechanic: drag from the ball to set direction and power. The second, more innovative method, used the device’s accelerometer to simulate a real throw. You’d hold the device and make a throwing motion to toss the ball. I called this mechanic "RealToss".
    </p>
    <p>
      RealToss was simple: place your thumb on the screen and drag to choose the throw’s direction, then make a throwing motion with your arm and release your thumb at the apex to launch the ball.

      At first, I thought RealToss was a great idea, but after testing with users, it turned out to be impractical—especially in public. The accelerometer data was noisy and varied from device to device, making consistent results hard to achieve. Eventually, I scrapped RealToss and focused on refining the tap-and-drag controls.

      I never fully finished the project. A couple of years later, I revisited the rules and codebase, improving them with the experience I gained at WhatWapp. But life got busy, and I never found the time to complete it. Bocce Galore has since been removed from the Play Store.
