    <p>The <strong>Leagues</strong> feature introduces a weekly competitive system where players earn points
      through matches to
      climb through six levels. Performance determines whether a player is promoted, stays in their current
      league, or is relegated, with the leaderboard resetting every Monday.</p>

    <p>Players compete within their own league as well as on a global scale. The <strong>League
        Leaderboard</strong> tracks performance within a specific tier, while the <strong>Global
        Leaderboard</strong> highlights the highest-scoring players across all leagues, showcasing the best of
      the best.</p>

    <p>The leagues implement a sophisticated UI focused mainly on leaderboard components while maintaining a
      lightweight graphical footprint. Instead of instantiating individual game objects for every leaderboard
      entry, which would be resource-intensive, I adopted a data-driven approach. By leveraging the <a
        href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/enhancedscroller-36378" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">EnhancedScroller</a> plugin, I efficiently recycle scroll rect elements,
      enabling the leaderboard to dynamically render an effectively unlimited number of entries with minimal
      performance overhead.</p>

    <p>At the end of each week, players receive rewards based on their final ranking in their league. Higher
      positions offer better rewards, which are distributed throughout the following week, incentivizing
      consistent and competitive play.</p>
    <p>We wanted to create visually engaging animations to present the outcome of the competition to users.
      The animation needed to clearly convey whether the player was <strong>promoted, demoted, or remained in
        the same
        league</strong>. I aimed to incorporate <strong>3D elements</strong> of the league shields to as a
      personal experiment. However,
      integrating 3D visuals into this project wasn’t straightforward. Since the entire application is
      UI-driven, the main camera is configured without a 3D perspective, and introducing one would require
      significant architectural changes. </p>
    <p>To enable 3D rendering of the shields, I first modeled each one in <strong>Blender</strong>. After
      importing them into
      Unity, I applied a simple unlit material to the meshes. To display them within the UI, I set up a
      separate off-screen camera that renders the 3D models to a <code>RenderTexture</code>. This texture is
      then assigned
      to a <code>RawImage</code> component in the UI. This setup allows the 3D shields to be animated in the
      scene while
      remaining visually integrated with the existing UI system.</p>
    <p>To complete the visual presentation, I created custom particle systems to add impactful finishing
      effects.</p>
